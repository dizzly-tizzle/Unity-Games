In this repository I saved several games that I made while was learning Unity. 
I'm currently learning Unreal Engine and don't feel like going back to Unity.
Let these projects be here so that in years from now I could see where I started)

### Easy Thief
This is my first game.
The gameplay is very simple:
- to win you need to match 3 identical numbers in a row;
- but to do this, you only have a few buttons that can increase one number while decreasing another;
- u also have a timer that runs pretty fast, so you need to use your brain quickly to win).
- the game also has a small plot)
  
Enjoy <3

### Seeds & Flames


### Pinball
